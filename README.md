# Face recognition program.

>The language I'm going to use is Python.
<br>

The libraries and algorithms needed are `OpenCV` and `Harcascade classifiers`

## My goals
A project to get close to face detection algorithms.

## If you want to know more about the project, refer to the link.

## Install it.

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```
> Harcascade classifiers ==> https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades
